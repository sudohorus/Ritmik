# Ritmik Roadmap

## Phase 1: The "Social" Player
*Focus: Making music a shared experience, something Spotify/YouTube Music lack in real-time.*

- [ ] **Discord Integration 2.0**
  - [ ] Rich Presence (via desktop bridge/app).
  - [ ] "Invite to Listen" button in Discord.
- [ ] **User Profiles & Social Graph**
  - [ ] "Taste Match": Compare your music taste with a friend (%).
  - [ ] Activity Feed: See what friends are listening to right now.
  - [ ] Pinned Playlists & Bio.

## 🎨Phase 2: Customization & Power User
*Focus: Giving users control that big streaming services refuse to give.*

- [ ] **Theme Engine (CSS)**
  - [ ] Allow users to write custom CSS.
  - [ ] "Theme Store" (Community shared themes).
  - [ ] Dynamic colors based on album art (Mood Ring).
- [ ] **Advanced Audio**
  - [ ] 10-Band Equalizer with presets.
  - [ ] Audio Normalization (ReplayGain).
  - [ ] Crossfade & Gapless Playback.

## Phase 3: Discovery & Intelligence
*Focus: Better ways to find music than just "algorithms".*

- [ ] **Smart Stats (Better than Wrapped)**
  - [ ] Real-time stats dashboard (not just yearly).
  - [ ] "Listening Clock": See what genres you listen to at different times of day.
  - [ ] Export data to JSON/CSV.
- [ ] **Contextual Search**
  - [ ] Search by lyrics.
  - [ ] Search by "Vibe" (e.g., "Sad songs for rainy days").

## Phase 4: Ecosystem

- [ ] **Mobile App** (React Native / Expo) - Offline support is key here.
- [ ] **Desktop App** (Electron/Tauri) - Native global media keys, Discord RPC.
- [ ] **TV Mode** - 10-foot UI for living rooms.
- [ ] **Public API** - Let developers build bots/plugins for Ritmik.
